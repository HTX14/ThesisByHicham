    <p><img src="../assets/line1.png"/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mendix is ​​a fairly complex platform, in these months of internship I have seen an improvement in use, thanks to applications that required a structured workflow in a certain way, it's also to widgets that I learned to integrate to enrich the application's functionality, and much more.</p>
