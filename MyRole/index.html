    <p>My role is to assist customers who need one or more applications that do certain things, and that they have the right functionality for the case.
      I develop applications in Mendix, a low-code platform.
      the interested customers speak to Giorgio Moia, my tutor and the IT manager, who informs me of the need for an application, then we move on to have direct contact with the customers through meetings, where they express their needs on what the application, having taken note of all the information, we move on to development while remaining in contact with customers, when the application is completed, tests are carried out with customers in accp (acceptance, online) and if the app works correctly, it is puts into production, then online is usable.</p>
    <p>Overall, the role of a Mendix developer combines aspects of software development, design, customization, and collaboration to create and maintain enterprise applications using the Mendix platform's low-code capabilities.</p>
