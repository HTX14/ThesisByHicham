    <p>The only way to create a unified development experience that strikes the right balance of ease of use, expressiveness, and flexibility is through deep integration across the entire Smart App stack. A much deeper and broader stack than they are state app platforms. That's why they joined forces with Siemens. The combination of the Mendix Low-Code platform and Siemens MindSphere uniquely covers all elements of the Smart App stack. MindSphere is Siemens' open cloud-based IoT operating system that includes IoT connectivity, asset management, time series storage, of events, data processing and analysis services (e.g. anomaly detection, signal calculation, trend prediction). We intend to create a unified, AI-assisted development experience with deep integration of MindSphere's event management, data and analytics services into Mendix, to create the world's leading low-code and (industrial) IoT platform.</p>
