    <p>To conclude, during these six months of internship I found in Siemens a truly welcoming and stimulating work environment, which supported me for the entire duration of the internship.
my colleagues, both junior and senior, have always been available to help me in case of need, I believe that the strength of this team, of IT, is precisely the great collaboration that exists between us and also between the departments.
I met a professional environment who gave me a vision of my future position that I will cover and helped me clarify my goals and give myself new ones.
I started developing applications with a development platform never used before, but I must say that I like it, and I would like to continue developing with this low-code platform, which is also the future of development that is increasingly catching on.
to conclude, I thank Siemens for this fantastic experience which has given me a professional and quality cultural background to include in my career.
