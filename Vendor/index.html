    <p>Vendor aims to make a list of suppliers available to all, the suppliers are linked to siemens with a contract, also called active (A).
      while suppliers who do not have a link with siemens but who could be new partners are called the possible (P).
      the list of suppliers therefore contains the entire list of suppliers, the user can search using a keyword in the table filter and search for one or more suppliers, for example: "Antenna", "Monitor", "Photovoltaic Panels" etc.
      the table has more filters that allow the user to do a more detailed search, search by fields:
      Services, Vendor Name, Location, Country, SAP Code
      status (green for active suppliers, blue for possible suppliers).</p>

<br>
<p>This is the table containing all the values.
  the table has 23 records, in fact scrolling to the right you can see all the other attributes of a supplier, while clicking the arrow at the top right you change the page displaying the other suppliers in the table.</p>
